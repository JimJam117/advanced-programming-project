#  Maths Interpreter
## Advanced Programming Project, Group 9

Maths interpreter software composed of a lexer and parser (F#) and a GUI (C# WPF). Makes use of the [scottplot](https://scottplot.net) library to display basic linear equations in plotting mode. This software is capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponential operations. Integer, floating point and rational data types are supported. Variables are supported and are displayed in a GUI symbol table. Finally, the software can handle coefficient numbers on terms and respects the laws of precedence (BODMAS).
